<h3>Basics:</h3>

<p>As poker is a gambling game, the goal is to take money from your opponents.  You do this by trying to determine the strength of your opponents hands while hiding the value of your own.  Once you have a good idea of how your hand compares to your opponents then you bet accordingly. Learning this is the most important poker skill.  The order of a round is below<p>

<ol style = "margin-left:15em">
	<li>Players are all dealt two cards</li>
	<li>Round of betting</li>
	<li>Three cards from top of the deck are displayed (Flop)</li>
	<li>Round of betting</li>
	<li>Single card from the deck is displayed (Turn)</li>
	<li>Round of betting</li>
	<li>Single card from the deck is displayed (River)</li>
	<li>Round of betting</li>
	<li>Remaining players show their hands, highest hand wins</li>
</ol>

<p>The rounds of betting are used to get more money in the pot, or to price players out of the hand. For example, if your hand is weak, but you suspect that your opponents is also weak, you can bet, and get them to fold.  However, if your hand is great but you want to put more money in the pot, you bet small amounts or none at all so your opponent thinks you are weak. <p>

<h3>Betting:</h3>

<p>First, it is important to know the three options when the action comes to a player. Bet, Check/Call, Raise, Fold.  The definitions for these terms can be found above.  If a player doesn't want to match a bet, they fold and forfeit their hand. If at any point during a hand all but one player has folded, that person wins the pot and no more cards are shown. </p>
<p>When the hand is dealt, two players to the left of the dealer automatically bet the small and big blinds respectively.  The big blind is 1/50th of the max buy in, and the small blind is half the big blind.  The player to the left of the big blind acts first. As the action comes to each person, they either call raise or fold, until everyone has had a chance to call or fold the largest bet.  Next, the dealer shows the flop.  The action starts with the person to the left of the dealer.  This continues until players reach the point of showing their hand, or a player steals the pot.

<p>The options check and bet are crossed out because the player can no longer start a bet or pass the action.  The only two options are raising and folding.  The above image also shows the Dealer and the two automatic bets to the left(assuming the max buy in is 500$).</p>

<h3>Example Round:</h3>

<p>Try and figure out how your hand is doing, and see who wins at the end of the round.  Use the Hand Ranks page for assistance.  Results of the hand are posted below  (After each click there would be a round of betting)<p>
