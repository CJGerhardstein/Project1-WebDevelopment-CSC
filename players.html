	<h4>"The Poker Brat"</h4>
	<p>
		Aside from Hellmuth's unpredictable "poker brat" personality, this Californian poker player 
		has had a successful poker career. He has acquired thirteen WSOP bracelets, won 
		the Main Event of the 1989 WSOP, as well as the Main Event of the 2012 World Series of Poker Europe. 
		He accompanies Daniel Negreanu as a member of the Poker Hall of Fame. Hellmuth shares his knowledge 
		with the public by making instructional poker videos and writing a number of books. Dropping out 
		of college to play poker ended up working out for Hellmuth as his total live tournament winnings 
		amount to $18,175,409.

	<h3>Phillip Ivey</h3>

	<h4>"The Tiger Woods of Poker"</h4>
	<p>
		Numerous poker observers and contemporaries consider Ivey the best all-round 
		player in the world today. He has won ten WSOP bracelets, one World Poker Tour title, 
		and has appeared at nine World Poker Tour final tables. At age 38, he is the youngest 
		player to ever win ten WSOP bracelets. In 2014 he lost an attempted lawsuit against a British casino he 
		accused of witholding his $12.4 million winnings. The casino convinced the court that Ivey kept track 
		of card values by watching for design imperfections on the backs of the cards, and so they did not end up 
		paying him anything. As of 2014, Ivey's total live tournament winnings exceed $21,400,000. He has also 
		won millions playing online and in cash games.
